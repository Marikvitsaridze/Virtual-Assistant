1. What is programming, really?
Programming is about giving instructions to a computer. If we don’t tell it exactly what to do, it won’t understand or complete the task. Unlike humans, who can often guess the meaning even when details are unclear, a computer needs every step to be perfectly precise.

2. Why do we need functions in programming?
In everyday life, we often repeat the same tasks. For example, we might have to boil water for tea multiple times, but a smart kettle would let us do it remotely without walking back and forth each time. In programming, functions serve a similar role—we write a set of instructions once (like boiling water) and then reuse them whenever we need.

3. What makes information useful vs. just data?
Information needs to be organized to be truly useful. If we don’t write down important details, we might forget or lose them. That’s why I store important information securely, while I use a simple notebook for everyday notes.

4. How do computers 'think' differently than humans?
Humans can guess, assume, and come up with creative interpretations. Computers can’t-they only do what we explicitly tell them. That’s why instructions must be accurate and complete for a computer to carry out the task correctly.

5. What would make a personal assistant truly helpful?
A helpful assistant would automate repetitive tasks and make daily life easier. Ideally, interacting with it would be simple and natural-just like having a conversation where it clearly understands what I need and follows through effectively.

6. How do you break down complex problems into simple steps?
When I plan a trip, I start by choosing the destination, then I buy flight tickets, book accommodation, and finally plan local activities. I keep everything organized and break it down step-by-step so the whole trip runs smoothly.
